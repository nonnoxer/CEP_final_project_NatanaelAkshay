# Learning Journey Allocation

This learning journey (LJ) allocation program is designed to allocate students to certain LJs based on their choices and time submitted. This program takes in 2 separate files which contain all the necessary data and outputs a few sets of files for convenience.

## Getting Started

To use this program, simply run it and type in your desired input files (in a .csv format), and it will quickly process them and create a few sets of output files (in a .csv format).

### Prerequisites

In order to run this program, you will need to have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed as this program runs using Python 3.

### Input

You will need a set of input files with the format of the following files:

```
venuesExample.csv
choicesExample.csv
```

### Usage

The program will automatically request the desired venue and choice files from the user upon start.

### Output

The program will output 3 sets of files:

1. The master output file containing the allocations of all the students
2. An output file for each class of students
3. An output file for each learning journey
